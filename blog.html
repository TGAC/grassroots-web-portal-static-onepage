        <p>One of the major aims of the Grassroots Infrastructure is to allow users to share their wheat data as easily
            and seamlessly as possible. To do this, we use <a class="darker" href="https://irods.org/"

            distributed storage viewable across different institutions and the ability to add metadata to all of the

                            <p>One of the major aims of the Grassroots Infrastructure is to allow users to share their
                                wheat data as easily and seamlessly as possible. To do this, we use <a

                                which is a system allowing users to create files and directories as normal with extra
                                features such as distributed storage viewable across different institutions and the
                                ability to add metadata to all of the files and directories. </p>

                                        title="Davrods - An Apache WebDAV interface to iRODS">Davrods</a> to allow
                                access to it using standard WebDAV commands. There were still some functionality that we
                                wanted to add that was missing from Davrods, namely:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Themeable listings</li>
                                <li>Public access</li>
                                <li>Metadata display</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="toc_2">Themeable listings</h3>

                            <p>The standard web pages produced by Davrods resembled the basic directory listings
                                produced by Apache and we wanted to increase the functionality of these pages as well as
                                making their look and feel customisable. To do this we based our approach upon that used
                                by the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_autoindex.html">autoindex
                                    module</a>[4]. We added the ability to customise the HTML that would go in the head
                                section of the web page as well as the parts before and after the iRODS directory
                                listings. Along with this, the columns of the listings table were marked up to allow for
                                easy styling. The link to get to the parent collection was replaced with a full
                                navigation element with a full set of breadcrumbs.</p>

                            <p>Another concept that we replicated from the autoindex module was the ability to specify
                                default icons to use for the data objects and collections along with more difficult
                                icons depending upon their file types.</p>

                            <p><img src="img/edit_metadata.png" width="100%" title="Edit metadata"
                                    alt="Editing the metadata in a browser"/>
                                Figure 1: Editing the metadata within a browser.</p>

                            <h3 id="toc_3">Public access</h3>

                            <p>iRODS workflow is based around the idea that users log in to see the data that they have
                                permissions to access. Often for websites, there is a desire to give public access to
                                browse a list of files and directories without the need to log in. So another feature
                                that we added to Davrods was the ability to have a default user to be specified in the
                                Apache server configuration that would be used to log into the iRODS system without the
                                need for any user intervention. In effect, creating a public-facing website
                                indistinguishable from one that allows a user to browse regular files and
                                directories.</p>

                            <h3 id="toc_4">Metadata display</h3>

                            <p>One of the major benefits of iRODS is its ability to add metadata as attribute-value
                                pairs to any of the data objects or collections stored within it. The ability to view,
                                edit and search across this data is a really useful feature for end users and so we
                                wanted to add these capabilities to Davrods too. Two features we wanted available were
                                to expose each of the metadata attribute-value pairs as hyperlinks to find data objects
                                or collections also containing the same pair, as well as having a general search
                                functionality to search across the entire metadata collection. Going further, adding the
                                ability to add, edit or delete metadata from within in a web browser was another really
                                useful feature that we wanted.</p>

                            <p>To do this we created a Representational state transfer (REST) API for querying and
                                manipulating the iRODS metadata. The base address for this API is at
                                /davrods/api/metadata though this can be changed to be anything you would like by
                                altering the parameter in the Apache configuration. It contains the following
                                functions:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><p><strong>get</strong>: This is for getting all of the associated metadata for an
                                    iRODS item. It takes two parameter, the first is <em>id</em>, which is the iRODS id
                                    of the data object or collection that you wish to get the metadata pairs for. The
                                    second parameter is <em>output_format</em> which specifies the format that the
                                    metadata will be returned in. It currently can take one of the following values:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>json</strong>: This will return the metadata as a <a
                                                href="http://www.json.org/">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> array
                                            with each entry in the array having <em>attribute</em>, <em>value</em>, and
                                            where appropriate, <em>units</em> keys for its key-value pairs.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>csv</strong>: This will return the metadata as a table of
                                            comma-separated values with the order of the columns being attribute, value,
                                            units. Each of these entries will be contained within double quotes to allow
                                            for commas within their values without causing errors.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>tsv</strong>: This will return the metadata as a table of
                                            tab-separated values with the order of the columns being attribute, value,
                                            units. Each of these entries will be contained within double quotes to allow
                                            for commas within their values without causing errors.
                                        </li>

                            <p>To demonstrate this REST API, we have developed some client-side JavaScript functions so
                                that users can call all of these routines comfortably and intuitively from within their
                                web browser.</p>

                            <p>We have two example sites to show the enhancements that we have made. The first demo site

                            <!--which is a system allowing users to create files and directories as normal with extra-->

                            <!--wanted to add that was missing from Davrods, namely:</p>-->

                            <!--<ul>-->
                            <!--<li>Themeable listings</li>-->

                            <!--<h3 id="toc_2">Themeable listings</h3>-->

                            <!--<p>The standard web pages produced by Davrods resembled the basic directory listings-->
                            <!--produced by Apache and we wanted to increase the functionality of these pages as well as-->
                            <!--making their look and feel customisable. To do this we based our approach upon that used-->
                            <!--by the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_autoindex.html">autoindex-->
                            <!--module</a>[4]. We added the ability to customise the HTML that would go in the head-->
                            <!--section of the web page as well as the parts before and after the iRODS directory-->
                            <!--listings. Along with this, the columns of the listings table were marked up to allow for-->
                            <!--easy styling. The link to get to the parent collection was replaced with a full-->
                            <!--navigation element with a full set of breadcrumbs.</p>-->

                            <!--<p>Another concept that we replicated from the autoindex module was the ability to specify-->
                            <!--default icons to use for the data objects and collections along with more difficult-->
                            <!--icons depending upon their file types.</p>-->

                            <!--<h3 id="toc_3">Public access</h3>-->

                            <!--<p>iRODS workflow is based around the idea that users log in to see the data that they have-->
                            <!--permissions to access. Often for websites, there is a desire to give public access to-->
                            <!--browse a list of files and directories without the need to log in. So another feature-->
                            <!--that we added to Davrods was the ability to have a default user to be specified in the-->
                            <!--Apache server configuration that would be used to log into the iRODS system without the-->
                            <!--need for any user intervention. In effect, creating a public-facing website-->
                            <!--indistinguishable from one that allows a user to browse regular files and-->
                            <!--directories.</p>-->

                            <!--<h3 id="toc_4">Metadata display</h3>-->

                            <!--<p>One of the major benefits of iRODS is its ability to add metadata as attribute-value-->
                            <!--pairs to any of the data objects or collections stored within it. The ability to view,-->
                            <!--edit and search across this data is a really useful feature for end users and so we-->
                            <!--wanted to add these capabilities to Davrods too. Two features we wanted available were-->
                            <!--to expose each of the metadata attribute-value pairs as hyperlinks to find data objects-->
                            <!--or collections also containing the same pair, as well as having a general search-->
                            <!--functionality to search across the entire metadata collection. Going further, adding the-->
                            <!--ability to add, edit or delete metadata from within in a web browser was another really-->
                            <!--useful feature that we wanted.</p>-->

                            <!--<p>To do this we created a Representational state transfer (REST) API for querying and-->
                            <!--manipulating the iRODS metadata. The base address for this API is at-->
                            <!--/davrods/api/metadata though this can be changed to be anything you would like by-->
                            <!--altering the parameter in the Apache configuration. It contains the following-->
