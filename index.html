            <p>With the data-generative approaches that are increasingly common in modern life science research, it is
                vital
                that the data and metadata produced by these efforts can be shared and reused. The Grassroots
                Infrastructure
                project wraps up industry-standard software tools with a consistent API that can be federated on a
                number of
                levels. This means institutions and groups can deploy a simple lightweight virtual machine, expose local
                data, connect up any existing data services, and federate their instance of the Grassroots with others
                out-of-the-box.</p>

            <p>The Grassroots Infrastructure uses a controlled vocabulary of JSON messages to communicate, so any server
                or
                client that can understand JSON can be used to access and connect to the platform. We provide
                infrastructure
                to ensure that the scientific data remains the important factor, and not the worry about how to build a
                system to expose your data.</p>

        <h3>Designing Future Wheat:</h3>
        <p>Grassroots has traditionally been the result of an effort to produce an interoperable data sharing platform
            for the wheat community. Whilst Grassroots is by no means organism-specific, our main use cases come from
            the wheat community. We get most of our community feedback from plant researchers at the EI, JIC, Bristol
            University, and other UK institutions, as well as from various international wheat working groups such as
            the <a class="darker" href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/wheat-data-interoperability-wg.html"
                   target="_blank">RDA Wheat Data
                Interoperability maintenance group</a> and the <a class="darker"
                                                                  href="http://www.wheatinitiative.org/activities/expert-working-groups/wheat-information-system"
                                                                  target="_blank">Wheat
                Initiative Wheat Information
                System expert working group</a>. The newly awarded cross-institute programme grant,
            Designing Future Wheat (DFW), is the first flagship project of its kind to bring the UK’s wheat researchers
            together to deliver new varieties relevant to the international stage, through the coordinated effort of
            biologists, breeders, and informaticians. As such, Grassroots is funded by the DFW programme, enabling us to
            build a platform that can meet the needs of not only this ambitious programme, but the wider UK and
            international wheat community that needs fast and openly-licenced unfettered access to the data and
            experimental information arising from DFW.</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <h3 id="toc_1">Introduction</h3>

                            <p>One of the major aims of the Grassroots Infrastructure is to allow users to share their
                                wheat data as easily and seamlessly as possible. To do this, we use <a
                                        href="https://irods.org/" title="iRODS: Open Source Data Management Software">iRODS</a>[1]
                                which is a system allowing users to create files and directories as normal with extra
                                features such as distributed storage viewable across different institutions and the
                                ability to add metadata to all of the files and directories. </p>

                            <p>iRODS comes with command-line clients to allow access to its storage and Chris Smeele and
                                Ton Smeele developed an Apache httpd[2] module, <a
                                        href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/davrods"
                                        title="Davrods - An Apache WebDAV interface to iRODS">Davrods</a>[3] to allow
                                access to it using standard WebDAV commands. There were still some functionality that we
                                wanted to add that was missing from Davrods, namely:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Themeable listings</li>
                                <li>Public access</li>
                                <li>Metadata display</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="toc_2">Themeable listings</h3>

                            <p>The standard web pages produced by Davrods resembled the basic directory listings
                                produced by Apache and we wanted to increase the functionality of these pages as well as
                                making their look and feel customisable. To do this we based our approach upon that used
                                by the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_autoindex.html">autoindex
                                    module</a>[4]. We added the ability to customise the HTML that would go in the head
                                section of the web page as well as the parts before and after the iRODS directory
                                listings. Along with this, the columns of the listings table were marked up to allow for
                                easy styling. The link to get to the parent collection was replaced with a full
                                navigation element with a full set of breadcrumbs.</p>

                            <p>Another concept that we replicated from the autoindex module was the ability to specify
                                default icons to use for the data objects and collections along with more difficult
                                icons depending upon their file types.</p>

                            <p><img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="img/edit_metadata.png" width="100%"
                                    title="Edit metadata" alt="Editing the metadata in a browser"/>
                                Figure 1: Editing the metadata within a browser.</p>

                            <h3 id="toc_3">Public access</h3>

                            <p>iRODS workflow is based around the idea that users log in to see the data that they have
                                permissions to access. Often for websites, there is a desire to give public access to
                                browse a list of files and directories without the need to log in. So another feature
                                that we added to Davrods was the ability to have a default user to be specified in the
                                Apache server configuration that would be used to log into the iRODS system without the
                                need for any user intervention. In effect, creating a public-facing website
                                indistinguishable from one that allows a user to browse regular files and
                                directories.</p>

                            <h3 id="toc_4">Metadata display</h3>

                            <p>One of the major benefits of iRODS is its ability to add metadata as attribute-value
                                pairs to any of the data objects or collections stored within it. The ability to view,
                                edit and search across this data is a really useful feature for end users and so we
                                wanted to add these capabilities to Davrods too. Two features we wanted available were
                                to expose each of the metadata attribute-value pairs as hyperlinks to find data objects
                                or collections also containing the same pair, as well as having a general search
                                functionality to search across the entire metadata collection. Going further, adding the
                                ability to add, edit or delete metadata from within in a web browser was another really
                                useful feature that we wanted.</p>

                            <p>To do this we created a Representational state transfer (REST) API for querying and
                                manipulating the iRODS metadata. The base address for this API is at
                                /davrods/api/metadata though this can be changed to be anything you would like by
                                altering the parameter in the Apache configuration. It contains the following
                                functions:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><p><strong>get</strong> : This is for getting all of the associated metadata for an
                                    iRODS item. It takes a single parameter, <em>id</em>, which is the iRODS id of the
                                    data object or collection that you wish to get the metadata pairs for. For example
                                    to get the metadata for a data object with the id of 1.10021, the URL to call would
                                    be </p>

                                    <p><code>/davrods/api/metadata/get?id=1.10021</code></p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>search</strong>: This API call is for getting a list of all data objects
                                    and collections that have a given metadata attribute-value pair. It takes two
                                    parameters: <em>key</em>, which is the attribute to search for and, <em>value</em>,
                                    which specifies the metadata value. There is a third optional parameter,
                                    <em>units</em> for specifying the units that the metadata attribute-value pair must
                                    also have. So to search for all of the data objects and collections that have an
                                    attribute called <em>volume</em> with a value of <em>11</em>, the URL to call would
                                    be </p>

                                    <p><code>/davrods/api/metadata/search?key=volume&amp;value=11</code></p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>add</strong>: This API call is for adding a metadata attribute-value pair
                                    to a data object of collection. It takes three parameters: <em>id</em>, which is the
                                    iRODS id of the data object or collection to add the metadata to, <em>key</em>,
                                    which is the attribute to add and, <em>value</em>, which specifies the metadata
                                    value to be added. As with the <em>search</em> call listed above, there is a fourth
                                    optional parameter, <em>units</em> for specifying the units that the metadata
                                    attribute-value pair will have. So to add an attribute called <em>volume</em> with a
                                    value of <em>11</em> to a data object with the id of 1.10021, the URL to call would
                                    be </p>

                                    <p><code>/davrods/api/metadata/add?id=1.10021&amp;key=volume&amp;value=11</code></p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p><strong>edit</strong>: This API call is for editing a metadata attribute-value
                                    pair for a data object of collection and replacing one or more of its attribute,
                                    value or units. It takes the following required parameters: <em>id</em>, which is
                                    the iRODS id of the data object or collection to delete the metadata from,
                                    <em>key</em>, which is the attribute to edit, <em>value</em>, which specifies the
                                    metadata value to edit. Again, there is an optional parameter, <em>units</em> for
                                    specifying the units that the metadata attribute-value pair must also have to match.
                                    There must also be one or more of the following parameters to specify how the
                                    metadata will be altered: <em>new_key</em>, which is for specifying the new name for
                                    the attribute, <em>new_value</em>, for specifying the new metadata value and <em>new_units</em>
                                    for specifying the units that the metadata attribute-value pair will now have. So to
                                    edit an attribute called <em>volume</em> with a value of <em>11</em> and units of
                                    <em>decibels</em> for a data object with the id of 1.10021 and give it a new value
                                    of 8 and units of litres, the URL to call would be </p>

                                    <p><code>/davrods/api/metadata/edit?id=1.10021&amp;key=volume&amp;value=11&amp;units=decibels&amp;new_value=8&amp;new_units=litres</code>
                                    </p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>delete</strong>: This API call is for deleting a metadata attribute-value
                                    pair from a data object of collection. It takes three parameters: <em>id</em>, which
                                    is the iRODS id of the data object or collection to delete the metadata from, <em>key</em>,
                                    which is the attribute to delete for and, <em>value</em>, which specifies the
                                    metadata value to delete. As before, there is a third optional parameter,
                                    <em>units</em> for specifying the units that the metadata attribute-value pair must
                                    also have to match. So to delete an attribute called <em>volume</em> with a value of
                                    <em>11</em> and units of <em>decibels</em> from a data object with the id of
                                    1.10021, the URL to call would be </p>

                                    <p><code>/davrods/api/metadata/delete?id=1.10021&amp;key=volume&amp;value=11&amp;units=decibels</code>
                                    </p></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>To demonstrate this REST API, we have developed some client-side JavaScript functions so
                                that users can call all of these routines comfortably and intuitively from within their
                                web browser.</p>

                            <p>We have two example sites to show the enhancements that we have made. The first demo site
                                <a href="https://wheatis.tgac.ac.uk/davrods/browse/reads/">https://wheatis.tgac.ac.uk/davrods/browse/reads/</a>
                                is a website showcasing the anonymous access among with theming and read-only access to
                                the metadata. The <a href="https://grassroots.tools/davrods/">https://grassroots.tools/davrods/</a>
                                showcases the ability to add, edit and delete metadata attribute-value pairs for the
                                available data objects and collections and is available at .</p>
