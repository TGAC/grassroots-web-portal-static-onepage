                <p>The Delivering Sustainable Wheat (DSW) Institute Strategic Programme (ISP), 
                    a BBSRC-funded collaborative effort involving ten leading research institutes and universities in the UK.
                     Our goal is to develop new wheat germplasm that contains the next generation of key traits to address 
                     the challenges faced by the global wheat industry. Together, we are committed to developing sustainable 
                     solutions to the challenges faced by the global wheat industry.</p>
    
                <p>Wheat is an essential crop globally and is a staple in the UK and Western Europe. 
                    With a projected population of 10 billion by 2050, the need for sustainable wheat production is urgent. 
                    However, the current production of wheat is fragile. The majority of the world's supply comes from just 
                    five countries and climate change, new diseases, and declining water resources pose significant challenges
                     for farmers.</p>

                <p>Through DSW, we aim to provide new germplasm that is readily accessible and referenced to
                     commercial crop breeders and the plant science community. 
                     This will help accelerate the development of new wheat varieties that are more resilient and 
                     productive, and able to meet the growing global demand for this important crop.</p>
