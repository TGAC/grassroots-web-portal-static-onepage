                <p>Grassroots has traditionally been the result of an effort to produce an
                    interoperable data sharing platform
                    for the wheat community. Whilst Grassroots is by no means organism-specific, our main use cases come from
                    the wheat community. We get most of our community feedback from plant researchers at the Earlham Institute, John Innes Centre, Bristol
                    University, Rothamsted Research and other UK institutions, as well as from various international wheat working groups such as
                    the <a  href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/wheat-data-interoperability-wg.html"
                           target="_blank">RDA Wheat Data
                        Interoperability maintenance group</a> 
                        and the <a href="http://www.wheatinitiative.org/activities/expert-working-groups/wheat-information-system"
                                                                          target="_blank">Wheat
                        Initiative Wheat Information
                        System expert working group</a>. The newly awarded cross-institute programme grant, Delivering Sustainable Wheat (DSW) and its predecessor
                    Designing Future Wheat (DFW), are flagship projects to bring the UKâ€™s wheat researchers
                    together to deliver new varieties relevant to the international stage, through the coordinated effort of
                    biologists, breeders, and informaticians. As such, Grassroots is funded by the DSW programme, enabling us to
                    build a platform that can meet the needs of not only this ambitious programme, but the wider UK and
                    international wheat community that needs fast and openly-licenced unfettered access to the data and
                    experimental information arising from DFW.</p>
